# Documentation Guide

We want our sponsors and stakeholders to view our product, **CoastCompanion**, in the best way possible. One way to make a good first impression is to have a good landing page that also acts as a Documentation page. This short **internal** documentation discusses what the **CoastCompanionDemo** website is for, and how to make great documentation (including release notes, documentation, work-in progress, etc) using Docusaurus.

### Website Structure

- [Main Page](/)
  - Landing page for both the **CoastCompanion Chatbot**, and the **CoastCompanion Admin Panel**,
- [Development Page](/dev/roadmap)
  - Development Roadmap
  - **Pre-Release Notes** (v0.x.x) for better presentation to the TAs and Sponsors for Dev Releases,
- [Documentation Page](/docs/intro) (for final deliverable, not public yet)
  - **Release Plan Overview** (a summary)
  - **Overview of Enviornments** (Dev, QA, Prod)
  - **Training Manual** (User Documentation)
  - **Release Notes** for v1.0.0 and warrenty releases (v1.x.x)

  - Indivudal profile, things we specialized in, things we liked (shameless LinkedIn plug)
  - A gallery of team pictures during the entire development stage

  - Quick **Work-In-Progress (WIP)** updates for better and detailed presentation to the TAs and Sponsors,
  - Highlight a specific Tech used, additional features, and future suggestions for post-release that doesn't quite fit in the release documentation.
  - Anything that was out-of-place to put in our assignments, but you still want Sponsors and TAs to know. For example: *a story of how we changed from Lex+Kendra to Bedrock.*
  - A place to show off more about you and your knowledge **(get hired)**
