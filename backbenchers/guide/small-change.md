# Making Small Changes

If you are only making small changes to invidual pages and posts in Markdown/Mdx and **not** React pages like the front page or the Team page, GitHub is all you need for you to contribute. 
- **You must have edit access to the Demo Page GitHub Repository** (unless you are forking, which is inconvenient for small changes).
- In one of the posts/pages currently deployed [GitHub Pages](https://thed3vel0per.github.io/CoastCompanionDemo) you want to edit, click on 'Edit This Page' button at the bottom of each page/post and edit the md/mdx file.
  - The link will bring you do the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheD3vel0per/CoastCompanionDemo) on the **main branch**, where you can directly edit the files.
  - Make your edit, leave a commit message, and commit.
  - You can "preview" markdown using GitHub, but you won't be able to preview what it would actually look like on the Demo website with Styles.
  - Editing on GitHub will **not** deploy changes to GitHub Pages. The deployment is done by Devam after reviewing changes.
