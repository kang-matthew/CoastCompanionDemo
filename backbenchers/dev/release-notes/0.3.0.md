# Version 0.3.0 - Release Notes

## General Notes:

There are two logins for the admin panel.

- Username: admin | Password: Password@1
- Username: TestAdmin | Password: Testing@2



## Revamped Admin Panel UI:

We have greatly improved the style of our Admin Panel UI to make it more user-friendly, and a new design that keeps in mind of a CoastCompanion admin's workflow.

### Admin UI

## Known Issues:

The following are known issues we have discovered but have not fixed in this current version:

- Chatbot is overtuned to only respond to questions about onboarding. May not respond to greetings like "hello" when it should be expected to.
- Response times for the chatbot are still being improved.
